# Installing

The easiest way of "installing" these fonts to the system is to put them in ~/.fonts/ directory (Linux).
However, by using the .fonts dir the fonts will be available only to your specific user, and not to the whole system.

To make it available to the whole system, put them *somewhere* in /usr/share/fonts -- depending on your Linux distro.
